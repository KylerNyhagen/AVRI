# AVRI - Articulate Virtual Response Interface
###What is AVRI?

AVRI is, simply put, an alternative< to the popular speech recognition softwares such as "Siri", "Cortana", and "Google Voice/OK Google". While these programs have an absolute slew of useful features, I found that, given that they tailor towards all people of various technical backgrounds, that it simply felt...impersonal.

With AVRI, the end goal is to allow the user to input custom commands for AVRI to listen to. This way, you can say things like "Give me a beat" to open your music program, as well as other features! This way AVRI has a more personal feel, and when you speak, you actually feel like the way <em>you</em> speak is being taken in to account!


####What do I need to run AVRI?
<ul>
  <li>PyOwm (Weather) (pip install pyowm)</li>
  <li>PyAudio (To have AVRI listen for microphone) (pip install pyaudio)</li>
  <li>speech_recognition (Allows AVRI to decipher what you say) (pip install speechrecognition)</li>
</ul>

####What is left to be done?
* Learning Custom Commands
* Allow users to add different ways to speak to open other programs
* And more...
